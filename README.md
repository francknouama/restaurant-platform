## 🚀 Frontend Application

The frontend is a modern React application built with:

- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Vite** for fast development and building
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **React Query** for server state management
- **Zustand** for client state management
- **React Router** for routing
- **Comprehensive testing** with Vitest

### Quick Start - Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## 📚 Documentation

### Frontend Documentation
See [frontend/README.md](./frontend/README.md) for detailed frontend documentation including:
- Setup instructions
- Architecture overview
- API integration
- Testing guide
- Deployment instructions

### Backend Documentation
Backend implementation and documentation will be added based on the existing backend codebase analysis.

## 🔧 Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd full-stack-app
   ```

2. **Install frontend dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

4. **Start development servers**
   ```bash
   # Frontend
   cd frontend && npm run dev
   
   # Backend (when implemented)
   cd backend && npm run dev
   ```

## 🏛️ Architecture Overview

### Frontend Architecture
- **Component-based architecture** with reusable UI components
- **Custom hooks** for business logic
- **Centralized state management** with Zustand
- **API layer** with React Query for caching and synchronization
- **Type-safe** development with TypeScript
- **Responsive design** with mobile-first approach

### Planned Backend Architecture
- RESTful API design
- Authentication and authorization
- Database integration
- Error handling and logging
- API documentation

## 🧪 Testing

### Frontend Testing
```bash
cd frontend
npm run test                 # Run all tests
npm run test:coverage        # Run with coverage
npm run test:ui             # Run with UI
```

### Test Coverage
- Unit tests for utilities and hooks
- Component tests for UI components
- Integration tests for API interactions
- E2E tests for critical user flows

## 📦 Deployment

### Frontend Deployment
The frontend can be deployed to various platforms:

- **Netlify** - Automatic deployment from Git
- **Vercel** - Zero-config deployment
- **AWS S3 + CloudFront** - Static hosting
- **Docker** - Containerized deployment

### Production Build
```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
```
