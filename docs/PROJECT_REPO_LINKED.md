## 💡 GitHub Projects v2 Explanation

Modern GitHub Projects (v2) are **user/organization-level** by default, but can be **linked to repositories**. This means:

- ✅ Project is owned by your user account
- ✅ Project can be linked to multiple repositories
- ✅ Project appears in linked repository's Projects tab
- ✅ Repository collaborators can access the project
- ✅ Issues from the repository automatically sync

This is the recommended approach for modern GitHub project management!
