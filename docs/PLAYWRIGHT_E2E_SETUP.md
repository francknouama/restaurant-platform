# ✅ Playwright E2E Testing Setup Complete

## 🎯 Overview

Successfully implemented comprehensive end-to-end testing using Playwright for the Restaurant Platform's micro-frontend architecture.

## 📦 What's Been Added

### **Playwright Configuration**
- `playwright.config.ts` - Multi-browser testing setup
- Auto-start all 6 MFE servers (ports 3000-3005)
- Desktop & mobile browser coverage

### **E2E Test Suites**

#### 1. **Shell App Tests** (`shell-app.spec.ts`)
- ✅ Application loading and initialization
- ✅ Authentication flow testing
- ✅ Navigation between MFEs
- ✅ Role-based access control

#### 2. **Cross-MFE Communication** (`cross-mfe-communication.spec.ts`)
- ✅ Order creation → Kitchen queue updates
- ✅ Kitchen status → Orders status sync
- ✅ Inventory alerts → Dashboard notifications
- ✅ Reservation creation → Dashboard updates
- ✅ Menu updates → Orders availability
- ✅ Event history tracking

#### 3. **Restaurant Workflows** (`restaurant-workflows.spec.ts`)
- ✅ Complete order lifecycle (creation → completion)
- ✅ Reservation → table assignment → order creation
- ✅ Inventory low stock → purchase order workflow
- ✅ Kitchen queue management during peak hours
- ✅ End-to-end analytics and reporting

#### 4. **Performance Tests** (`performance.spec.ts`)
- ✅ Application load times (<3s target)
- ✅ MFE lazy loading efficiency (<2s each)
- ✅ Cross-MFE communication speed (<10ms events)
- ✅ Concurrent user simulation
- ✅ Memory usage monitoring

### **Test Helpers**
- `helpers/auth.ts` - Authentication utilities for different user roles
- `helpers/test-data.ts` - Test data generators and mock objects

### **Package.json Scripts**
```json
{
  "test:e2e": "playwright test",
  "test:e2e:ui": "playwright test --ui",
  "test:e2e:headed": "playwright test --headed", 
  "test:e2e:debug": "playwright test --debug"
}
```

- Kitchen MFE: `http://localhost:3003`
- Inventory MFE: `http://localhost:3004`
- Reservations MFE: `http://localhost:3005`

### **CI/CD Integration**
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow updated
- ✅ Automatic browser installation
- ✅ Playwright report artifacts on failure
- ✅ Performance metrics collection

## 🧪 Test Categories

- Form submissions and validations

### **Integration Testing** 
- Cross-MFE event bus communication
- Real-time updates between modules
- Data consistency across MFEs
- Module Federation loading

### **Performance Testing**
- Core Web Vitals monitoring
- Bundle size and load time verification
- Memory leak detection
- Concurrent user handling

### **Business Workflow Testing**
- Complete order processing flow

## 📊 Test Execution

### **Local Development**
```bash
# Run all E2E tests
pnpm test:e2e

# Interactive UI mode
pnpm test:e2e:ui

# See browser (headed mode)
pnpm test:e2e:headed

# Debug specific test
pnpm test:e2e:debug tests/e2e/shell-app.spec.ts
```

### **CI/CD Pipeline**
